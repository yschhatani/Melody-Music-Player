#Project description
This application is based on several different components
• Mainly the application consist of large keyboard from which several tunes can be generated
• Different types of wave forms are used to get different sounds
The applicaiton has two different versions
• Version-1 , Simple Melody Music Player where there are no chords.
• Version-2, Advanced Music Player where there is bigger output with chords.
Version 1
The application consist of two types of versions. The version one is Simple Melody Music
Player in which there are no chords.The research paper shows the study of melody and based
on that understanding the version 1 is created.
In version 1 - simple melody music player, only one note per column can be selected and
can be seen who it produces the sound. The keyboard consists of around 1000 keys due to
which it becomes interactive and can be learnt in easy way. Although there are different kinds
of option available for the user to select such as the oscillator wave types and the sound speed
and frequency.
After selecting the keys and input the user can press then play button to listen to the sound.
Version 2
In version 2- advanced Music player, many chords can be selected and produces a bigger output. In this version, we can insert single single alphabets and listen and the alphabet off each
sound. In this too, the keyboard is too large and having around 1000 keys and given more
options to the user, the application can be learnt in meaningful way.

The system will have a keys keyboard and will have partition
in between to differentiate different melodies. The keyboard keys will be based on user manual
input. Depending on that tune will be played. Thousand number of tunes can be generated
through this system. Moreover, keyboard can be customized in different and interactive way.
Certain types of input can be inserted. Inputs such as Name of a person or any other name
and analyzing that how the sound of each alphabet is produced.In addition to that system will
contain different types of oscillator mainly sine, square, sawtooth, and triangle the user can
select any one of them and can play the melody tune. Besides that, the system will consist
option to manipulate the tune in terms of tempo., hertz and other features. Hence it will be
a fun and interactive tune player and will showcase classic musical experience.The difficulty
level of this system can be considered in terms of additional features. Although there are several
music players which consist keyboard keys but are restricted to size and can play only one type
of tune. i have made two versions in this system. The first version consist of no chords and
second version consist of chords and gives bigger output.
